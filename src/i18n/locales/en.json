    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "Does insurance cover the program?",
    "a1": "Yes. While we are not in-network with most providers, we provide detailed invoices for direct reimbursement. Dr. Thorne's protocols are backed by peer-reviewed biomechanical research, qualifying for many insurance plans under 'rehabilitation services.'",
    "q2": "How much time does this actually require?",
    "a2": "Only 15 minutes per day. The Catalyst Method prioritizes efficiency over duration. Each protocol is designed for integration into your existing routine—no gym membership required.",
    "q3": "Why is the Catalyst Method different?",
    "a3": "Most physiotherapy is pain management. The Catalyst Method is performance architecture. We don't just fix the problem; we rebuild your body to perform beyond your previous capacity. Every exercise is data-driven and progression is measurable.",
    "q4": "What if I have a complex injury history?",
    "a4": "That's exactly who benefits most. Dr. Thorne specializes in multi-system injuries and chronic pain cases that haven't responded to traditional approaches. Your complexity is your advantage.",
    "q5": "What happens after the 12 weeks?",
    "a5": "You receive a lifetime maintenance protocol and access to quarterly check-ins with Dr. Thorne. The program ends, but your transformation continues.",
    "q6": "Can I do this remotely?",
    "a6": "Yes. Initial assessment is in-clinic for movement analysis. Follow-ups are available remotely via video. Complete customization based on your location and preferences."
